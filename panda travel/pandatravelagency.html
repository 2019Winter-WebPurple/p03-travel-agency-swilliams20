        <p>Saint Barthelemy, also known as St. Barth or St. Barts, is a French-speaking island in the Caribbean. It is known commonly known for its white-sand beaches and designer shops. The capital, Gustavia, encircling a yacht-filled harbor, has high-end restaurants and historical attractions like the Wall House, whose exhibits highlight the island’s Swedish colonial era. Perched above town is 17th-century Fort Karl, looking out over popular Shell Beach.</p><!-- first paragraph give basic info on island  -->

        <blockqoute><p>St. Barth was originally inhabited by Arawak Indians; they were followed by the Caribs, who greeted Christopher Columbus when he arrived in 1493. He named the island for his brother Bartoloméo. The French made initial unsuccessful attempts to settle it until some determined Huguenots from Normandy persevered and prospered. Later, French buccaneers made it a way station as they plundered Spanish galleons, which adds to St. Barth's lore.</p></blockqoute><!-- used blockquote because these paragraphs are from a website -->
        
        <blockqoute><p>In 1784, France traded the island to Sweden, and the capital was named Gustavia – in honor of its king, Gustavia III – and declared a free port. (To the delight of shoppers, it remains free.) In 1878, it was sold back to France, but charming reminders preserve the past in street signs and the Swedish Cemetery. Those touches delightfully enhance St. Barth's European ambience.</p></blockqoute>

        <blockqoute><p>Tourism took hold when Rémy de Haenen, an eccentric Dutch aviator, landed his plane at what is now the airport. He later became the first hotelier and the island's mayor. Rémy hosted the era's luminaries – he was a friend of Howard Hughes – and Hollywood starlets. The '60s brought the Rockefellers and Rothschilds and saw the arrival of the first jet-setters. Thus, the mystique was created. The '70s brought spectacular yachts like Onassis's Christina into the Lilliputian Harbor in Gustavia.</p></blockqoute>

        <blockqoute><p>"Well... it was an amazing week for us in St. Barth!!! The Villa Orion was simply outstanding! In perfect condition and exquisitely located, we literally soaked up the sun each day. Mid-afternoon's found us enjoying a lovely French Margaux while relaxing in the shade in the chaise loungers. A truly renewing time. I would return again,again and again. A'deal was the concierge that met us at the ferry terminal in Gustavia. He is a lovely young man...warm,friendly and gracious. Certainly an asset to your organization. Thank you again, so very much for accommodating us at this fabulous property. It was the best vacation I've ever experienced!! C.P.

        <blockqoute><p>"Our trip was amazing!!!! We love St Barths and we have been coming to St Barths for years and by far "Villa Passage" was off the charts (The Best). Your Services were amazing and I have and continue to recommend you and St Barth Properties for any villa rentals. R.W. Newton MA."</p></blockqoute>

        <blockqoute><p>"We had an amazing time in St. Barth. The villa was exceptional, and the views were breathtaking. The island definitely lived up to its reputation of world class dining. While we enjoyed every restaurant we visited, our favorites were Black Ginger (the green curry was amazing!), Bonito (amazing views), and Bagatelle. The concierge team was wonderful and confirmed every reservation with ease. We loved the seclusion of Saline and Gouverneur beach. St. Jean beach was beautiful as well and it was fun watching the planes take off! Overall an amazing experience, and we hope to return in the future! Thanks again for all your help! M.K.  Cabot AR."</p></blockqoute>
